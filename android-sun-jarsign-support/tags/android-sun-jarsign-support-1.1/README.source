This project contains a modified version of Sun's security APIs.
Specifically it the Sun code required to develop a working Jar/Zip/Apk
signing application for the Android platform.

The code was obtained from the OpenJDK project.  It is licensed under
the General Public License (GPL), version 2.

* Some code from sun.security.provider.X509Provider was copied into
  sun.security.x509.X509CertImpl and X509CRLEntryImpl
  (BEGIN,END,intern()).  This was done to eliminate the need to
  include sun.security.provider.* as dependency.
  
* Some classes were removed to further reduce dependency requirements
  (e.g., sun.security.util.Password, which reads passwords from the
  command line).

* A copy of java.util.Arrays.copyOf(byte[],int) was made to
  sys.util.Arrays.copyOf(byte[],int). The java.util.Arrays
  version is not available on Android.
  
* In most cases modified code can be found by searching for comments 
  containing "out:kellinwood" (removed code) and/or "in:kellinwood" 
  (added code), or "mod:kellinwood" (modified code).
